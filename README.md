# 阅读须知

这个仓库是占位符(仓库主人对外的别名)为了记录自己的"一生一芯"学习记录，并且对项目代码做分支管理和进度保存而创建的
# 根据"一生一芯"项目组要求，一生一芯的学习应当独立自主完成，如果您是或可能是该项目的学员，请不要阅读任何您不该到达的代码
# 如果您不是该项目学员，请不要将此代码外传，十分感谢
我想，学会代码背后的思想远比复制这个代码更有意义


# NOTICE

This repository is created by 'placeholders' (aliases of the repository owner, a student at SZTU) to record their "One Student One Chip" learning records, and to branch manage and save the project code
# According to the requirements of the "One Student One Chip" project team, the learning of One Student One Chip should be completed independently, if you are or may be a student of the project, please do not read any code that you should not reach
# If you are not a student of this project, please do not share this code, thank you very much
I think it's far more meaningful to learn the idea behind the code than to copy it
