# "阅读须知"

这个仓库是占位符(仓库主人对外的名字)为了记录自己的"一生一芯"的学习过程和对项目代码进行分支管理、进度保存而建立的

根据"一生一芯"项目组要求，"一生一芯"项目的学习应独立完成，不可借鉴他人代码
# 所以，如果您是或可能是该项目的学员，请不要阅读任何你不应到达的代码
# 如果您不是该项目的学员，也请不要将代码内容外传，谢谢
我想，学会代码背后的思路，应该比复制这个代码更有价值



# NOTICE

this repository is created by 'placeholder'(The nickname of the repository owner, a student at SZTU), to record his "One Student One Chip" learning process and to branch manage and save progress of the project code.

According to the requirements of the "One Student One Chip" project team, the learning of the "One Student One Chip" project should be completed independently and should not be borrowed from other people's code
# So, if you are or may be a student of this project, please do not read any code that you should not reach
# If you are not a student of this project, please do not share the code content, thank you
I think learning the idea behind the code should be more valuable than copying the code
